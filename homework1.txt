(1) x = 55

(2) range(1,21)

(3) range(2,21,2)

(4) for x in range(10)
		print random.randint(1,100)

(5)	"import some_module" will import the whole module,
	where functions will need to be called explicitly 
	with dot notation.
	
	"from some_module import *" is considered bad practice,
	and instead specific modules should be imported.
	
	However, these two will perform the same action by pulling
	functions in, assuming all functions have unique names.
	
(6)	The comma at the end of print statement will concatenate the
	string onto the same line, without the comma each print statement
	is printed onto a new line.
	
(7)	(0,0) is located in the bottom left hand corner.

(8) The first block of code has no comma, so if x is an even number
	even and number will appear on seperate lines.  In the second block
	the words even and number will appear on the same line.

(9) 
	#defining a class Book
	class Book:
	
		def __init__(self,title,year,pages):
			self.bookTitle(title)
			self.yearOfPublication(year)
			self.numberOfPages(pages)
		def getBookTitle(self):
			return self.bookTitle;
			
	#to get variable from class Book
	eggsandham = Book("Green Eggs and Ham",1960,72)
	
	eggsTitle = eggsandham.getBookTitle()
	
(10)The purpose of the line is to declare a start label for
	the program.  This is equivalent to int main() in C++
	
	There is no difference in execution, however having the label
	of main will allow scripts to be included elsewhere in
	other programs or other scripts.
